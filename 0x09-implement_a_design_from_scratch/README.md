# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch


For this project I have to implement a design from scratch using all that we learned from previous projects. 
- HTML
- CSS
- Accessibility
- Responsive design

These projects can be found in my [holbertonschool-web_front_end](https://github.com/SeckMohameth/holbertonschool-web_front_end) repository.

## Project
We weren't given a lot of instructions and are free to implement it the way we want. The objective is to have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the design files given to us.

## Requirements
- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript

## Motivation
I'm excited to put what I've learned into practice. My goal once completing my studies is to apply for a frontend position so knowing how to work with designers is crucial.It also sparks my interest in UI/UX since that is also a field of interest for me as well.
